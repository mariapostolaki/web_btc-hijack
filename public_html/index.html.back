            <div class="jumbotron" >
                    <p>We study the impact that Internet routing attacks (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking">BGP hijacks</a>) and malicious Internet Service Providers (ISP) can have on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Because of the extreme efficiency of Internet routing attacks and the centralization of the Bitcoin network in few networks worldwide, we show that the following two attacks are 
						<b>practically</b> possible today:</p>					
                    <p>
						<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> <b>Partition attack:</b> Any ISP can partition the Bitcoin network by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking">hijacking</a> few IP prefixes.
                    	<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> <b>Delay attack:</b> Any ISP carrying traffic from and/or to a Bitcoin node can delay its block propagation by 20 minutes while staying completely under the radar. </p>
                    <p>
                    The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. Among others, these attacks could <b>reduce miner's revenue</b> and render the network much more susceptible to <b>double spending</b>. These attacks could also prevent merchants, exchanges and other large entities that hold bitcoins from performing transactions.<p/>
                    <p>The purpose of our research is to inform the Bitcoin users and miners as well as suggest long and short-term countermeasures. Check our <b><a href="files/btc_hijack.pdf">paper</a></b> for more details.</p>

                    <p>Although one can run a Bitcoin node anywhere on earth, the nodes that compose the network today are far from being spread uniformly around the globe.</p>

                    <p>Particularity, our results indicate that <b>most of the Bitcoin nodes are hosted in few Internet Service providers (ISPs)</b>: 13 ISPs (0.026% of all ISPs)
                    host 30% of the entire Bitcoin network (left graph).
                    <p>Moreover, <b>most of the traffic exchanged between Bitcoin nodes traverse few ISPs</b>. Indeed, our results indicate that 60% of all possible Bitcoin connections cross 3 ISPs. In other words, 3 ISPs can see 60% of all Bitcoin traffic (right graph).</p> 
					
					<p>Together, these two characteristics make it relatively easy for a malicious ISP to intercept a lot of Bitcoin traffic.</p>

                    <p> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking">BGP hijack</a> is a routing attack in which an ISP diverts Internet traffic by advertising fake announcements in the Internet routing system.</p>

                    <p><b>These attacks already affect the Bitcoin network, today.</b> Indeed, we found that, each month, at least 100 Bitcoin nodes are the victims of BGP hijacks, while 447 distinct
                    nodes (∼8% of the Bitcoin nodes) ended up hijacked in November 2015 (right graph).<p/>

     <p>ASSSSSSs the most successful cryptocurrency to date, Bitcoin constitutes a target of choice for attackers. While many attack vectors have already been uncovered, one important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the Internet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing advertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous Systems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin traffic.<p\>
     <p>This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on Bitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and large-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we show that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency of routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in terms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker can hijack few (&#60;100) BGP prefixes to isolate ∼50% of the mining power—even when considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that on-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by interfering with few key Bitcoin messages.<p\>
     <p>We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin software. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology using data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data.<p\>
     <p>The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the network or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide range of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice, we provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be deployed immediately.<p\>
